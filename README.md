# Robot Tamagotchi Simulation

Project for course DBM140 Embodying intelligent behavior in social context
Simulation of using SARSA algorthim (SARSA.py) to adapt behaviour policy of interactive robot tamagotchi companion (bunny.py),
interacting with programmatic agent representing a child-like behaviour (Child1.py).
The aim of the robot tamagotchi is to get the child agent to complete a peridically activating task of petting the robot.

### Narrative simulation
Run main.py for a console based simulation. The program will run the simualtion for 400 steps.
The program writes a narrative descrtiption of the interaction with the child and agent for each step.
When the program is completed, tables of the initial behavior policy will be printed with the finally developed policy for analyzing the differences.

### Graph simulation
Run learning_stats.ipynb tos drawn 8 simulaiton  into a graph of how the time for a child to complete a perdiodically activating task
